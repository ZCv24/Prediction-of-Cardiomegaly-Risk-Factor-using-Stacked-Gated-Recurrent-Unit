# Prediction-of-Cardiomegaly-Risk-Factor-using-Stacked-Gated-Recurrent-Unit
This paper examines the utilisation of Stacked Gated Recurrent Unit (S-GRU) for the purpose of predicting cardiomegaly. The results show that how medical criteria and machine learning can be used together to predict cardiomegaly in people with a high level of accuracy that matches the clinical test results.
